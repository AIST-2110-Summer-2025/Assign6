# Calculate the average temperature for each state
#   (set average_oregon and average_maine with these values)


# Determine which state has the lowest average temperature using if-else
#   (set chilliest_state with either 'Oregon' or 'Maine')


# Calculate the standard deviation for each state



# Determine which state has the most stable temperatures using if-else
#   (set most_stable_state with either 'Oregon' or 'Maine')
