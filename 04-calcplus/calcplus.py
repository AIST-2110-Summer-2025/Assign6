# import the i_am_human module


# ask the user for number 1
#     convert to a float and round to 4 decimal places
#     if it's not a float print 'INVALID NUMBER' and exit



# ask the user for number 2
#     convert to a float and round to 4 decimal places
#     if it's not a float print 'INVALID NUMBER' and exit



# ask the user for an operator
#     if it's not '+', '-', 'x', '/', or `^` print 'INVALID OPERATOR' and exit



# use if/elif/else to do the right steps based on the operator
#     calculate an answer using +, -, *, /, or ^
#     if the operator is `/` or `^`, use exception handling to catch an error,
#       and if caught set the answer to `ERROR``



# finally print the full equation with the answer
#   only use format_float here...do no rounding prior to the calculations
