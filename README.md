# Assignment 6: Using Functions and Modules

In this assignment, you will explore how to use functions and various Python
modules to extend the language's capabilities. Specifically, you will work with
some of Python's built-in functions as well as functions from the  `random`,
`calendar`, and `statistics` modules to solve different tasks.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the purpose and usage of Python functions and modules.
2. Learn how to import and use the `random`, `calendar`, and `statistics` modules in Python.
3. Apply functions to perform tasks related to randomness, date manipulation, and statistical analysis.

## Assignment Structure

The assignment is structured into the following exercise folders under the root
folder `assn-6-yourusername/`:

- `01-dice`
- `02-leapify`
- `03-temp`
- `04-calcplus`

Each directory contains specific tasks that you need to complete.

## Assignment Completion Procedures

You will complete and submit this assignment in a similar way to prior
assignments. To avoid cluttering up this README with the same instructions each
time, they have been broken out into a separate file. Please reference
[PROCEDURES.md](PROCEDURES.md) to see the details if you have forgotten.

In summary:

  1. Complete the code for each exercise per the instructions
